hi this is kavish 
today i am making mango ice cream
mango ice cream can only be made during the summer as mangoes only ripe during the summer
So this is a Three-ingredient mango ice cream made with mangoes, fresh cream and sugar/honey. Yes vanilla is also added, which makes it the fourth ingredient. But its entirely optional and you can simply skip it.



thank you
